# Predicting Liiga Game Outcomes Using Machine Learning

_this project is still a work in progress. This README will be updated later_

## Description
This project tries to predict which team wins the hockey game using historical game data and team statitistics. All the data is from [Liiga's](https://www.liiga.fi) website. 
The prediction is only a simple categorical one. The model tries to predict if the `home_team` variable is `True` or `False`.

### Current Status
- **Data Scraping**: Completed
- **Models**: Initial models built

### To-Do:
- **Analyzing the models**: Analyzing more deeply how the model performs, why, and what features affect the most
- **Cleaning the code**: Cleaning all the useless imports. Improve readability and performance
- **Cleaning the folders and files**: Making better folder structure and organization

### Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sqlite3`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `pickle`

These will be updated later, after the project is finished.
